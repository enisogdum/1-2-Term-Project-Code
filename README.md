## 🧠 Project Description

The goal is to create a structured C application that manages:

* Authors (with single linked list)
* Students (with double linked list)
* Books (and their copies, with single linked list)
* Book-Author relationships
* Book lending/returning operations
* All data stored in `.csv` files

## 📀 Data Structures

* `Author`: Stored in a **singly linked list**, ordered by `authorID`
* `Student`: Stored in a **doubly linked list**, with 8-digit ID and library score (starting at 100)
* `Book`: Stored by title and ISBN, copies have unique labels (ISBN\_1, ISBN\_2, ...)
* `Book-Author Relationship`: Stored in a dynamic struct array
* `Transaction`: Records student-book interactions (borrow/return)

---

## 📌 Functionalities

### 👨‍🎓 Student Operations

* Add, delete, update, and list students
* View student details and borrowed books
* List overdue or penalized students
* Borrow/return books with date & score checks

### 📚 Book Operations

* Add, delete, update, and list books and copies
* Track status of each copy (On Shelf / Borrowed by ID)
* View book details by title
* List books on shelf
* Show overdue returns
* Match/unmatch book-author data

### ✍️ Author Operations

* Add, delete, update, and list authors
* Show author's book list
* Book-Author mapping updates upon deletions

## 🧪 Sample Menu

```text
1. Add/Delete/Update Student
2. View Student Info
3. List Students With Unreturned Books
4. List Penalized Students
5. List All Students
6. Borrow/Return Book
7. Add/Delete/Update Book
8. View Book Info
9. List Books on Shelf
10. List Overdue Books
11. Match Book with Author
12. Update Book's Author
13. Add/Delete/Update Author
14. View Author Info
```

## ⚙️ Coding Requirements

* Use **dynamic memory** (no global/static variables)
* Implement all CRUD operations with appropriate **structs**
* Store data in **CSV files**
* Avoid code repetition: use **function pointers** where applicable
* Ensure **data integrity checks** before all operations

---

## 📹 Submission Requirements

* A **short video** (max 8 minutes) introducing yourself and demonstrating the program
* `.RAR` or `.ZIP` file named with your **Student Number**:

  ```
  10011089/
  ├── 10011089.pdf   # Project report with screenshots and test results
  ├── 10011089.c     # C source code
  └── *.csv          # All output files generated by your program
  ```

---

## ✅ Testing & Reporting

Your report must include:

* Sample inputs for all major functions
* Screenshots of the terminal during program usage
* Final states of all CSV files
* Lessons learned and sources used

---

## ⚠️ Notes

* Submissions will be checked for **plagiarism**
* Late submissions **won’t be accepted**
* Keep a screenshot of successful upload as **proof**
* Your instructor may contact you for verification

## 🙌 Good Luck!

This project will strengthen your understanding of:

* Data structures (linked lists, structs)
* File operations in C
* Dynamic memory handling
* Real-life problem modeling
